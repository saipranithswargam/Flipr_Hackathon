#Project Description
This website made by the four of us is the best implementation of MERN Stack. This is a Fintech website that displays data and graphs of 5 major stock bulls namely Tata, Cipla, Eichermot, Ashok Leyland and Reliance. It also displays the graph of NSE and BSE for the date 12th February 2023. For the frontend part of this website we used HTML, CSS and ReactJS framework also implementing the new NextJS for faster rendering of pages. We have deployed our frontend on Vercel a free hosting platform. For the backend of our website we have used NodeJS with Express as our framework. We used NoSQL database MongoDB for the storage of our data. For the authentication part we took the help of Oauth using Google Authentication and Github Authentication. Backend is hosted on a free hosting platform called render.com. Since our frontend and backend are hosted on two different platforms we used CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) to connect these two.
